## Utility

**Neural Lace**: Neural implant that grows through the entire structure of the brain, maps and records the brain state for resurrection and persona digitization. Also acts as a Brain Computer Interface for cybernetic augments, inlays, and noosphere connections. Cost: Very Expensive. Effect: +2d6 data searches and computer operations

**Augmented Sensor Suites**: A wide variety of sensor packages are available that connect to a Neural Lace and leverage the human sensorium to interpret data. If you want to see X-rays, taste molecules, or feel atmospheric composition, these sensor packages are for you. Each sensor package detects a specific thing and leverages a particular existing sense of your choice. Cost: Very Expensive. Effect: +2d6 when in use

**Teleoperated Drones**: A Neural Lace inlay that connects a set of semi-autonomous drones to your own brain, allowing you to operate and sense through the drones. A wide variety of drone packages are available from simple flying cameras to heavily armed and armoured combat drones. Cost: Very Expensive
