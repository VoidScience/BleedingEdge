“*That which does not kill us, makes us stranger*” —Trevor Goodchild

**Backgrounds**: Roll or choose from the list below…

**Playbook**: There is something about you that pushes you out into the Bleeding Edge of Humanity. Roll or choose…
1. **Hive Mind**: You are many and you are also one. Whether you are a group of disparate individuals who came together, or an individual that has Forked yourself into multiple bodies, or partitioned your own Mind, you are both a collective and a singular entity. 
2. **Machinist**: You have a deep affinity for mechanical things. You may even be more machine than flesh now, with cybernetic augmentations taking over for the frailties of biology, or living in an entirely synthetic shell. Your mind can connect with, talk to, and manipulate machinery on a deep and intuitive level. 
3. **Alien Hybrid**: When the archeo-geneticists recovered Non-Human DNA from the Martian Tomb sites it was only a matter of time before some freelance gene splicer got their hands on it. Bits and pieces of barely understood alien gene sequences have been spliced into your genome, awakening new abilities and an affinity for their technology
4. **The Grey**: A combination of technology and memetic basilisk hacks have made you the perfect infiltrator, able to leverage both bland anonymity and the weight of intimidatingly faceless bureaucracy to your advantage. 
5. **The Hollow**: You have had you experiences, skills, and personality stripped down the bare minimum chassis needed, leaving room for wearing new Personas like masks.
