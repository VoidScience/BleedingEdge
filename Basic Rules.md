## Rolling Dice
When you undertake an action that carries risk, or where the outcome is uncertain, you roll a Test of your chosen Approach to solving the problem. For all rolls, gather d6s equal to your rating in your **Approach**. If your **Background** applies, or you have any special **Skills**, add 1d6 to your **Dice Pool**. Equipment, Talents, or other Effects may add additional bonus dice.  You can spend Resolve 1-for-1 to add additional d6s to your Dice Pool. 

Roll the dice, if the highest die rolled is a 6, this is a **Success**. If it is a 4 or 5 this is a **Success With a Cost**, you get less than you wanted or with a consequence of complication. If your highest die roll was a 3 or less than prepare for the worst. 

**Critical Successes**: If you roll more than one 6, this is a Critical Success. You do whatever you were attempting better, quicker, or quieter. If this was a combat roll, deal additional weapon damage for every additional 6 rolled.

**Esoteric Procedures**: When you perform an Esoteric Procedure, make your roll as normal; however you must roll at least 1 Will Die, up to a maximum of your current Will. If you roll any 1s (Banes) on your Will Dice, decrease your current Will by the number of Banes and roll 1d10 on the appropriate Backlash Table. You must have at least 1 Will in order to perform an Esoteric Procedure.

**Stress and Wounds**: If you Succeed on a Combat Roll, deal the damage of your weapon to your target. If you get a Success With a Cost, you both deal damage to your target and they deal damage to you in the form of Stress. On a Failure you take damage in the form of Stress. Reduce any damage dealt or taken by the DR value of any armor worn. When your Stress track is filled, reset the Track and mark 1 Wound, rolling on the Wound table. When your Stress is higher than your current Resolve, you suffer a -1d6 penalty to your Dice Pool.

If your Resolve is reduced to 0, take 1 Wound. If your character fills their final Wound box they are in immediate danger and are bleeding out.  A successful medical Test is needed to stabilise them and prevent them from dying.

*All characters start with a Stress track of 5 and the ability to suffer 4 Wounds.*
